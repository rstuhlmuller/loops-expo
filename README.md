# Loops Mobile App

WIP

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

## Local iPhone development build

Install Xcode and CocoaPods, add your Apple ID in Xcode, and connect your iPhone
with Developer Mode enabled. Expo Go does not include the required native modules.

```bash
npm install
IOS_DEV_BUNDLE_ID=com.yourname.loops.dev npm run ios:device
```

Select your Personal Team for signing. This creates **Loops Dev** without push or
Apple Sign-In entitlements; use OAuth login. Save `IOS_DEV_BUNDLE_ID` in `.env.local`
and use `npm run start:dev` for subsequent sessions. Rebuild after native dependency changes.
